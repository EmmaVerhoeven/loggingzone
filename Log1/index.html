    <h1>ðŸš‚ A quick stop in the centre of the universe</h1>

		<p>When the delayed train finally arrived in Paris I had already missed the last train to Barcelona, and found myself at the same ticket office where only six weeks earlier we had waited while <a href="http://filelife.tours">Elliott</a> bought a night train ticket to pick up the spare key of the apartment we were staying at and that he had 
			lost the key of (will link key-log <a href="">here</a> when online). I asked how far I could make it that day, and they gave me a ticket until Perpignan, which I had never heard of before... </p>
		
		
		
		<p>I decided to book a room in a hotel right next to the station, just for convenience, I had a light fever and a painful throat and wanted to be in a bed ASAP. <i>This first night I will not care about the hotel</i>, I thought. <i>Cute, romantic hotels can come later in the trip. I just need to sleep and get to Spain.</i></p> 
		
		
		<p>Little did I know, Perpignan and specifically its train station, in 1963 had been proclaimed the centre of the universe by Salvador DalÃ­. Haha. Not Paris, not New York, but the train station of Perpignan. <i>Allright.</i> I thought. <i>Nice start.</i></p>

					<p>"Sooner or later, everyone changes trains at Perpignan. But the railway station in Perpignan held special significance for Salvador DalÃ­ (1904-1989), who had proclaimed it to be the â€˜Centre of the Universeâ€™ after he experienced a vision of cosmogonic ecstasy there in 1963: â€˜On 19 September 1963, standing in the railway station at Perpignan ... I had a precise vision of the constitution of the universe.â€™<br><br>
						For DalÃ­, the station in Perpignan became a place of genuine sanctity, a pivot of the cosmos that offered a unique perspective on the entire universe.<a href="http://www.patrickcomerford.com/2018/05/how-salvador-dali-came-to-see-perpignan.html" style="font-size:.7em">(source)</a>

			<p> The hotel next to the station was aptly called Hotel Paris-Barcelone, and it wasn't lugubrious at all, but in fact quite cute. I arrived there late at night with swollen tonsils, and the friendly receptionist gave me a free tea and two tiny bowls, one with honey and one with salt, and I showered and gargled with salt and then slept for ten hours, and many strange dreams.</p>
	
	
			
	
	<p>
		The next morning I woke up and stepped out on the balcony and looked to the right and thought to myself: <big><i>wow, this room has a view of the centre of the universe!<i/></big></p>
