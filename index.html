        <summary>ðŸŒ² On logging</summary>
        <div class="onlogging">
            <p class="intro">Welcome to this web-log. Iâ€™ve been saying it out loud: I want to log more! Logging as in keeping track, of thoughts
                and ideas, and moments, maybe. I call it logging because I donâ€™t want to limit myself to blogging/writing only, and see
                what other documentation-methods might bring me. And also to <b>draw</b> a parallel between logging
                trees
                and logging thoughts:</p>



            <img width="70%" src="logging-definition.png" />
            <br>


            <span class="sidenote">(To log trees, I know, it has a negative connotation, trees are a symbol of nature
                and goodness and (illegal!!) logging is a symbol of capitalism and climate crisis. But itâ€™s not inherently
                bad to log trees, I looked into it!)</span>



            <p>If you know me, you might know I often understand certain abstract parts of life through concrete metaphors. Lately, I have been visualising the inside of my head as a metaphorical forest made up of moments and experiences and
                thoughts
                and feelings, where every day certain trees grow and new seeds sprout, and maybe other trees die, (when
                you
                forget something or fall out of love with an idea) and the weather changes every day.</p>



            <p>Try imagining your own forest, if you like. It probably looks completely different from mine, or very different today than yesterday or a
                few years ago. Maybe when you are obsessed with something a certain type of tree takes over your
                forest, or maybe if you have a lot of routine in your life, your forest
                looks very neat and gridded, maybe you have planted a lot of little trees and you are waiting for them
                to grow, or maybe your forest is so dense you canâ€™t even walk there anymore, or so big that you get lost
                in it.<br></p>

            A question to think (or log) about:
            <span class="question"> What does your mental forest currently look like?</span>
            <br><br>

            <p>
                Mine feels quite spacious, as in, there is a lot of room for bigger trees to grow. Thatâ€™s probably
                because I currently don't have much going on. I have no steady job or big clients, no large projects going
                on, no real plans for the future. And I somehow feel very calm about that, birds are chirping in my
                forest and the sun is shining on the open space in the woods. Thereâ€™s a lot of little idea trees here
                and there, with leaves all different colors and shapes.
            </p>


            <p>Anyways, what happens when you log a tree from your forest? I don't know yet but this is my hypothesis:</p>

                    AKA set up a place for your logs to be collected and/or
                    published, maybe obtain a nice domainname that motivates you to log. But most of all: give yourself
                    permission to log and publish. You don't need anyone else's permission but, you need to give it to yourself for sure!
                </span>

                    species, and the quality
                    of the idea. Consider its location in the forest and its proximity to other themes in your
                    life. Some ideas are like
                    mighty oaks, while others may be delicate saplings in the forest of your life.

					Different equipment is used for cutting, sawing trimming different parts of the

                <span class="guideinfo">
                    First step in logging a tree is creating a notch, and after that, the felling cut. In life logging,
                    one way to make the initial notch might be by starting a new log file or page, and the felling cut
                    might be outlining the content of the log.

                <span class="guideinfo">
                    After logging a tree, you trim branches and process the wood. Trimming and refining a log takes the most work. Some small branches and leaves may distract from the main idea. You could refine and sand wood until it is smooth like plastic, but visible knots and flaws can be a nice reminder of the source material.
