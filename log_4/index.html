        <p><b>In February</b>, I decide to see a psychologist for the first time in my life. I have various reasons,
            though I
            struggle to verbalise them; I guess I just feel stuck, and my mind exhausted, even though I don‚Äôt do that
            much... In fact I hardly ever feel like I‚Äôm doing enough. Enough freelance work to pay the bills, sure, but
            when it comes to my own art practice, I feel a constant lack of time while ideas pile up and doubts hold me
            back from starting, and I get very, very frustrated with myself. I‚Äôm not sure if this is a cause or an
            effect of these psychological struggles, but I want something to change.</p>


        <figure class="right">
            <img width="180px" src="IWTBARF/11.png" alt="" />
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>After a lengthy intake session, the psychologist tells me there seems to be a significant disconnect between
            my head and body, or my thoughts and feelings. I guess she might have a point.
            She starts explaining how
            basically being constantly overactive in my mind causes my sympathetic nervous system (responsible for the
            'fight or flight' response) to work overtime, while the parasympathetic nervous system (promoting rest and
            digestion) isn‚Äôt getting enough time to help me relax, recover, regenerate.




            I have a very visual brain so I
            google an image to try and understand this theory better. It makes me see my body as a big system, which
            feels helpful, somehow. I imagine all the organs and muscles and limbs as places with little roads between
            them, some of them with happy energetic cyclists on them, others with a long traffic jam of heavy trucks
            filled with feelings, some roads completely blocked. This is how my mind works, I can‚Äôt help it.
        </p>


        <figure class="right">
            <img width="450px" src="IWTBARF/2.png" alt="" />
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br>

        <p>To help me restore the mind-body-imbalance, the psychologist refers me to another therapist, a more
            alternative one with a ‚Äòholistic‚Äô approach that focuses not just on talking but on the body as a whole. I
            have no idea what that entails, exactly, but I feel open to it and book an appointment for April, after my
            upcoming trip.</p>


        <br>

        <p><b>In March</b>, I take the train to Spain. To get away and hopefully think and write up new project ideas,
            and also
            to visit my youngest sister Ren√©e, who is working at a farm in M√∫rcia for four months, and has invited me to
            stay with her there. She is finishing her masters degree in Resilient Food and Farming Systems with an
            internship at a regenerative farm, specifically researching the needs of its cows and their holistic grazing
            methods.</p>




        <p>From what I understand, regenerative farming is all about improving the health of the entire ecosystem rather
            than just focusing on high yield. It aims to help build up the soil‚Äôs fertility, improve water retention,
            and boost biodiversity, while reducing the dependency on chemicals and pesticides. It‚Äôs about working with
            the land rather than against it. The goal is to create a sustainable system that benefits both the land and
            the people relying on it, making farming more resilient to climate change and other scary future challenges.
            It all sounds complex, abstract, and quite utopian to me.</p>
        <figure class="left">
            <img width="300px" src="IWTBARF/3.png" alt="" />
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>I am excited to spend time with Ren√©e, and to learn more about her research and regenerative farming in
            general. I know next to nothing about agriculture and I am not even that interested in it, but whenever
            Ren√©e passionately shares her biodynamic wisdom with me I can listen to her for hours. She has a very
            captivating yet clear way of talking about nature, and so much detailed knowledge on how plants and animals
            and insects and fungi all work together and communicate among each other and keep the ecosystems in balance.
            To someone like me, who spends most of their time in cities (and too much of it behind screens), listening
            to such information sometimes truly feels like inhaling fresh air.</p>


        <p>I arrive at the finca that hosts all the students and interns working at the farm, about ten of them. It‚Äôs a
            big house in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by large groves of almond and olive trees, with rolling hills
            and rugged mountains in the distance. We put an extra bed in Ren√©e‚Äôs tiny bedroom. On the floor there is a
            box with loudly chirping baby chicks that just hatched last night. I‚Äôll be staying for eight days.</p>

        <p>The other inhabitants are all around my sister's age, from different parts of the world but all studying
            something agriculture-related. Here at the farm they each have a very specific research topic they are
            exploring, using the farm fields for their field research. Some are taking soil samples or placing sensors
            in it to measure infiltration rates, some are working on ways to improve existing structures like the
            vegetable garden and the grazing schemes. There is a student who is researching compost, measuring the
            temperature of different compost-heap variations every day, and another one working on building various
            insect hotels on the farm premises. He knows exactly which insects live in the area, and which one benefits
            the ecosystem most, so he is trying to find out what would be the perfect sized holes for those particular
            insects and building them the ideal habitat. Such care!</p>

        <p>I am in awe of the amount of time and attention that goes into getting to know this land and its needs, in
            such detail, all with this shared goal of regeneration. These students are dedicated, giving attention to
            such a specific aspect of the landscape, together helping to slowly regenerate and improve the farmland.
            It‚Äôs inspiring. I don‚Äôt know exactly in what way, but I feel inspired.</p>


        <p>Life is slow here. In the morning, we get up whenever we feel like it, usually when the sun hits our pillows.
            We go down, make coffee, and drink it outside on the sunny patio. We do some stretches and talk to whoever
            is there having breakfast too. We check on the baby chicks and feed them. No one seems to be in any type of
            rush, ever. All day I see people reading, napping, baking treats, watching shows, and hanging out, even on
            weekdays during 'work hours‚Äô. I catch myself wondering, 'Don't they have more... work to do?‚Äô. Ren√©e somehow
            seems to read my mind and says ‚ÄúNow that you are around, I am so aware of how little I actually do here. Of
            course we have more intensive days where we plant trees or do other physical stuff. And I work on my
            research, but only around four hours a day. Those are my productive hours. The rest is for living.‚Äù</p>

        <p>Something about this way of living feels so right.</p>
        <p>‚ÄòThis is my kind of tempo,‚Äô I think to myself.</p>




        <p>I feel lucky that Ren√©e has so much time because she can spend so much of it showing me around the area and
            telling me about the farm. She takes me to the stables to visit the horses, and to cuddle the new puppies at
            the farm, and to spy on the shy turtles in the water reservoir. She shows me the vegetable garden and then
            the tree groves.
        <figure class="right">
            <img width="360px" src="IWTBARF/4.png" alt="" />
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>The pistachio trees are still tiny and leaf-less. Ren√©e constantly kneels down everywhere
        looking closely at the small plants growing in between trees, then telling me their name and their special
        qualities, and how they help the trees get more nutrients or attract certain insects that are somehow
        beneficial. I love learning all these little things even though I don‚Äôt really understand them. I do start
        to understand on a larger level how everything is connected and influencing one another. In the evenings we
        cook and eat together and watch movies or play crossword puzzles in Ren√©e's room.</p>


        <p>This is the perfect time and place for me to do nothing and rest, and I am definitely more relaxed than
            before, but I still feel quite restless. I try to live in the moment but can‚Äôt stop thinking about my work
            and what direction to take it in. I wonder which part of my nervous system is winning right now.</p>

        <p>I brought my laptop with me to write and work, so one day I install myself on the patio to do some of that‚Ä¶
            but I feel unsure of what to work on. For the first time in what feels like years, I don‚Äôt really have to do
            anything. No assignments, no commissions, no deadlines. Enough savings to last a few months, enough time to
            start something new, something I really want to spend my time on. I‚Äôve been craving this moment, but it
            feels quite scary now that it‚Äôs actually here.</p>

        <p>I try to remind myself of the things that inspire and excite me these days, but my mind goes blank. I think
            back to the last big project I felt excited about, which happened almost a year ago ‚Äìfar too long by my
            standards of productivity. That work started from workshops I did with teenagers in which they mapped their
            inner emotional worlds as landscapes, which then became a film about them showing us around those emotions.
            How very ironic that I created this whole method for kids to understand and express their feelings, and now
            I‚Äôm in therapy for that same thing. Maybe I should have tried mapping my feelings into a landscape first‚Ä¶?
        </p>
        <figure class="left">
            <img width="650px" src="IWTBARF/5.png" alt="" />
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <div class="clear"></div>

        <p>I imagine myself as a collection of farm fields, meadows and orchards, rolling hills and rugged mountains in
            the distance. There are fields where feelings grow and forests full of ideas and desires, and a water
            reservoir where energy is stored. Everything is connected and influencing one another.</p>


        <p><b>In April</b>, I‚Äôm back home again, but I keep thinking about that wholesome week at the farm. I tell my
            holistic
            therapist about how much I loved it, but that I did feel guilt for not working. She tells me I have an
            unhealthy relationship with work, and derive too much of my self-worth from how productive I feel. I guess
            she might have a point. And yes, I would love to return to that place of creating from joy and inspiration,
            rather than from this abstract pressure to perform and meet a self-imposed standard of productivity or
            success, I‚Äôm just not sure how. My therapist says it‚Äôs a journey we are going on together. I imagine me and
            her, walking through my inner landscape side by side. I wonder if we might need a tractor.</p>

        <p>After therapy I need a breath of fresh air, so I call Ren√©e. I tell her I want to turn all the regenerative
            farming inspiration from my visit into some sort of project, and ask her to tell me about how it works
            again, starting by explaining the opposite, ‚Äòdefault‚Äô way of farming.</p>

        <p class="renee">‚ÄúOk so, conventional agriculture is all about getting the biggest yields possible using
            intensive methods.
            Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilisers, pesticides, and herbicides to control pests and boost plant
            growth. This helps produce a lot of food, which is great for feeding large populations and supporting global
            food security. It‚Äôs often monoculture planting‚Äîso growing just one type of crop over large areas‚Äîand that‚Äôs
            super efficient. They can use machinery and streamline everything, which lowers labour costs and increases
            productivity. But the big downside is that all these chemicals deplete the soil‚Äôs natural nutrients and harm
            all the good microorganisms in it. Also, sticking to just one crop can lead to soil erosion and reduce
            biodiversity. It makes the whole system more vulnerable to pests and diseases, creating an even bigger
            dependency on chemical inputs. It‚Äôs not sustainable in the long term.‚Äù</p>

        <p>Am I operating too much like a conventional farm? If my body is a landscape, growing all these feelings and
            energies, like farmlands waiting to be harvested, maybe my mind is farming my body in a conventional way,
            slowly exhausting it?</p>

        <p class="renee">"Haha, yes,‚Äù <span class="emma">says Ren√©e,</span> ‚ÄúI guess if you are working like a
            conventional farm, you are constantly enhancing
            your performance by adding certain substances. Like caffeine and sugar, and also intangible things like
            stress, external pressure, and expectations from yourself and others, all ensure that you keep going, year
            after year, always trying to improve yourself and seeking a higher level of achievement. But it isn‚Äôt really
            for yourself, it feels like you‚Äôre doing it mostly for others. Essentially, the work controls you, and your
            body gets exhausted, and you can give less and less.‚Äù</p>

        <p>What would happen if I applied regenerative farming methods to myself? How would that change things?</p>

        <p class="renee">‚ÄúIf you want to be a regenerative farm, if you were to live regeneratively... Instead of just
            focusing on
            high productivity, you would aim to restore and improve the health of your entire system. It‚Äôs all about
            working with your body rather than against it, and also being very conscious of what you put into it. It
            creates this positive cycle where you feel better and better, and in turn your work gets better and you can
            also give more to the people around you. You might not be as ‚Äòproductive' right away, but in the long run,
            it‚Äôs way more sustainable. By living this way, you can give more, generate more value. And value doesn‚Äôt
            just mean work and money, it can mean quality, health, love even. This way, doing work doesn't cost you all
            your energy, but can even give you more energy back!‚Äù</p>

        <p>I imagine my mind as the farm that controls my inner landscape:</p>
        <figure class="left">
            <img width="800px" src="IWTBARF/6.png" alt="" />
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <div class="clear"></div>

        <p><b>In May</b> I call Ren√©e every week. She tells me more biodynamic stories and things she learned at the
            farm,
            which function as great tips and inspiration on how to be more like a regenerative farm.</p>


        <p class="renee">‚ÄúSo we went to visit this forest today.. There‚Äôs two kinds growing there: one is a native
            Spanish tree and
            the other one is an invasive pine species.</p>

        <p class="renee">An invasive species is a plant or animal that ends up outside its original habitat and spreads
            so fast that
            it pushes out the native species. A good example is the grey squirrel that came here from America. It steals
            food from the native red squirrels, breeds more easily, and is way less shy, so it started to dominate, and
            now the red squirrels are becoming endangered. Plants can be invasive too. Like they once tried to introduce
            this bamboo-like reed in Europe, because they thought it would be cool to create a ‚ÄòEuropean bamboo‚Äô. But
            this reed then pushed out the native reeds, and sucks up a lot of water from other plants, and it isn't even
            as strong as real bamboo, making it pretty useless.</p>

        <p class="renee">So yeah, invasive species are a real threat to biodiversity and the environment, they mess with
            the natural
            balance and damage ecosystems, so it‚Äôs quite important to be aware of their impact and try to prevent their
            spread.‚Äù</p>

        <p>I wonder if I have any invasive species living in my inner farmland. Things that weren‚Äôt there when I was a
            kid, but that slowly worked their way into my mind. Like the fear of failure, the perfectionism, the guilt
            around not working. I wonder how to prevent their spread.</p>

        <p class="renee">‚ÄúThere used to be a lot more oak trees in this forest, back in the day. Oak trees are a lot
            less prone to
            forest fires, in fact pine trees are the worst for forest fires because when a pine cone sets fire, it kind
            of explodes and launches itself metres far, spreading the fire super quickly.</p>

        <p class="renee">The thing is, it‚Äôs kind of a fact that once every five years there will be a huge forest fire
            somewhere in
            this area. It‚Äôs sad, but they need to prepare for it. So today this farmer explained how they are
            redesigning this forest, in a way that they give lots of space to all the little baby oak trees that are
            sprouting there, but get too much shade from the pine trees. So they find these baby oaks and look at what
            they need: where does the sun come from, which pine trees could we remove to give the oak more sun and space
            to grow bigger? And then they can only log the invasive pine trees, because the native ones are protected.‚Äù
        </p>

        <p>I can think of some invasive thought patterns I‚Äôd like to chop to make room for baby oak thoughts to grow
            bigger. It will take some time, but in case of a forest fire like life-disaster, I will probably thank
            myself later.</p>


        <p class="renee">‚ÄúA regenerative mindset is essential. Like this week, we planted a bunch of trees. Right now,
            they are just
            little saplings, but when they are bigger, they bring so many benefits to the ecosystem. They store carbon.
            Their deep roots improve water absorption and distribute nutrients in the soil. They also have a cooling
            effect by creating more shade, and promote biodiversity, by creating habitats for birds and rabbits. It‚Äôs
            like a big win-win-win situation for the ecosystem in the long run, but now, in the beginning, it‚Äôs hard for
            those trees to survive. They need a lot of water right now, which is not exactly a ‚Äòwin‚Äô for farmers,
            financially. It‚Äôs really expensive to transport water tanks, and even if the trees are donated, four
            full-time workers are needed to plant trees every day for six months and they need to be paid salaries as
            well.‚Äù</p>

        <p>That emotional mapping workshop I developed a few years ago is really starting to pay off now. It took a lot
            of time to get to the current format, but now I just get bookings and I don‚Äôt even have to think about what
            to do. I simply run the workshop and it gives me income, and a sense of purpose, and joy, and motivation,
            and it leads to other opportunities.</p>


        <p><b>In June</b>, my holistic therapist is doing acupuncture on me for the first time. She explains how all our
            organs
            are connected and work closely together, communicate between each other, and depend on one another.. and how
            they in turn are linked to our emotions and mental well being. She says that every needle is giving special
            attention to one organ or part of the body, giving them a little boost, helping the overall body, and also
            releasing emotions and other tensions.</p>

        <p>I smile while she tells me all this, because somehow the way she describes things reminds me of Ren√©e, and
            the farm, and this essay I am trying to write. I try to hide my smile because as the woman trying to help me
            put less pressure on work is putting needles in my back, I am secretly thinking about work. But she is
            helping me, because she just described me as an ecosystem and now I am sure I am on the right path to
            regeneration.</p>

        <p>I imagine the tiny needles are little students, dedicated, all giving attention to a specific aspect of my
            landscape, together helping to slowly regenerate and improve my inner farmland. It feels good.</p>
